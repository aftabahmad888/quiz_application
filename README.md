# Module 6 Challenge Web APIs: Code Quiz

I have been tasked to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will runs in the browser, and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It has a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. I researched for this task and took help from online resources like Google.com.

## Task and completion:

Create a code quiz that contains the following requirements:

* A start button that when clicked a timer starts and the first question appears.
###  I have created the web application which shows a start button. When this start button is clicked then first question appears on screen with the options and timer starts.

* The quiz should end when all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.
### I have made sure that when time goes to zero or all questions are done then the game ends.
